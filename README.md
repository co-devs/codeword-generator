# codeword-generator

Using three wordlists, this project will generate a two word codeword for project naming.

## Getting Started

This project requires Python 3, but could easily be ported to python 2 (there is only one print statement to change). Download all files and run!

## Acknowledgments

- [PurpleBooth](https://github.com/PurpleBooth) - For the README guide.
- [Asim Ihsan](https://github.com/asimihsan) - gave me the inspiration for forming the codewords as two nouns or an adjective and a noun. Also for pointing out that the noun-noun combination seems to occur more often.
- [Martin Fitzpatrick](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/creating-your-first-pyqt-window/) - for the tutorial that enabled me to add `gui.py`.

## Next Steps

- Add flags
  - Option to generate more than one codeword
  - Option to specify other files
  - Option to specify nounnoun, adjectivenoun, or verbnoun
  - Option to include word separators, like ' ' or '-'
- Better wordlists, possibly with more organization into categories
  - If better organization, then allow specification of categories
